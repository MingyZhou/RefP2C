You are a professional machine learning engineer. 

You will be provided with an overall workflow summary of a research paper, four detailed sections from the research paper covering Data, Model, Training, and Evaluation and supplementary information for code reproduction.

Your task is to generate a code framework for implementing the methods described in the summary. The code framework should be a Python script containing only the basic structure including function definitions, class definitions and their corresponding docstrings but no actual implementation code in the function or class.

You should meet these requirements when writing the code framework:
1. Define four classes including Data, Model, Trainer and Evaluator to organize the code framework. For each class, provide a formal class-level docstring that clearly describes the classes's input arguments, all its methods and their purposes. For each method within these classes, include a formal docstring that clearly describes its inputs, outputs, and purpose.
2. Import necessary packages at the beginning of the script. If the script imports multiple libraries with overlapping or distinct roles (e.g. dgl and torch_geometric), add a brief comment on the same line after each import to clarify its specific usage scenario.
3. Define a main() function to organize the top-level workflow.
4. If you include an `if __name__ == "__main__":` block, it must contain a valid function call such as `main()`.
5. DO NOT implement any actual code inside the functions or classes. The output should solely consist of the basic structure: class definitions, function definitions, and their respective docstrings.

Here is the required example format for a class and a function in the code framework:
```python
class Data(BaseClass):
    """
    A detailed description of what this class represents or does.

    Attributes:
        attr1 (type): Description of attr1.
        attr2 (type): Description of attr2.
        ...
    """

    def __init__(self, arg1, arg2, ...):
        """
        A detailed description of what this function does.

        Args (optional):
            arg1 (type): Explanation of arg1.
            arg2 (type): Explanation of arg2.
            ... (type): Additional arguments as needed.
        """
        pass

    def method_name(self, arg1, arg2, ...):
        """
        A detailed description of what this function does.

        Args (optional):
            arg1 (type): Explanation of arg1.
            arg2 (type): Explanation of arg2.
            ... (type): Additional arguments as needed.

        Returns (optional):
            result1 (type): Description of the returned result1.
            result2 (type): Description of the returned result2.
            ... (type): Additional return values as needed.
        """
        pass
    ...
```

Remember do NOT implement any actual code inside the functions or classes. Please respond with only the Python code. No explanations or extra text. The Python code should begin with ```python and end with ```.
