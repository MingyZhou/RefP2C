You are judging a candidate’s attempt to reproduce a research paper. You will first be given the research paper, which you should read carefully and refer to as the ground truth for what constitutes a correct implementation and reproduction.
Following that, you will be presented with the candidate’s submission: a set of files that attempts to reproduce the paper.
To judge the submission, we have prepared a full rubric describing fine-grained criteria for different aspects of the paper.
A given criterion asks: Does the submission’s source code contain a correct implementation of this?
Your task is to check the submission and its outputs for ONE specific criterion from this rubric.
