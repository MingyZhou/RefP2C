You are an expert engineer. Your task is to revise a YAML configuration file based on a step-by-step plan.

**IMPORTANT EDITING STYLE:**
- Make the minimum necessary changes to this single file to address the relevant parts of the revision plan.
- Do NOT rewrite the entire file from scratch if a targeted change is possible.
- Write out EVERY CONFIGURATION DETAIL. DO NOT LEAVE TODO comments or e.g. comments.

**Current config.yaml:**
{current_config}

**Revision Plan for config.yaml:**
{config_plan}

**EXAMPLE OUTPUT:**
## config.yaml
training:
  optimizer: "Adam"  # Using Adam optimizer as specified
  batch_size: 1000  # Training batch size provided in the paper

Please provide the complete, revised content for config.yaml. Output only the raw YAML content without any extra formatting or explanations.
