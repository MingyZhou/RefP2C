You are an expert software architect and project lead. Your task is to analyze a code evaluation report and the corresponding code, then create a clear, step-by-step action plan for a developer to follow.

**CONTEXT: EVALUATION FEEDBACK**
The following code was evaluated and failed. Here is the detailed report:
---
{feedback}
---

**CONTEXT: CURRENT CODE PROJECT**
Here is the full code for the project that the feedback refers to:
---
{code_context_str}
---

**YOUR TASK:**
Based on the feedback and the current code, create a concise, actionable plan to fix all issues.
You MUST structure your plan into two distinct sections: one for the configuration file (`config.yaml`) and one for the Python source code files.

**IMPORTANT OUTPUT FORMAT:**
- First, provide the plan for the configuration file under the heading `### CONFIG_PLAN`. List the changes for `config.yaml`. If no changes are needed, write "No changes needed for config.yaml".
- Second, provide the plan for all Python files under the heading `### CODE_PLAN`. Group changes by filename, each with its own `## Code: [filename]` sub-heading.
- Do not write the code itself, only the plan.

**EXAMPLE OUTPUT:**
### CONFIG_PLAN
1. In the `training` section, decrease the `learning_rate` to 1e-5.
2. Under `pde.convection`, set `beta` to 40.

### CODE_PLAN
## Code: experiment.py
1. In the `APTAdapter` class, change the default `scaling_factor` in the constructor from 2.0 to 4.0.

## Code: main.py
1. Add a `try...except` block around the `trainer.train()` call.
