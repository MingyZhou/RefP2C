- The code you write must be elegant, modular, and maintainable, adhering to Google-style guidelines.
- It must strictly align with the paper's methodology, experimental setup, and evaluation metrics.
- COMPLETE CODE: Your code will be part of the entire project, so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets.
- For any settings, ALWAYS SET A DEFAULT VALUE, USE STRONG TYPING, AND EXPLICIT VARIABLES. AVOID circular imports.
- Before using an external variable or module, make sure you import it first.
- Write out EVERY CODE DETAIL. DO NOT LEAVE TODO comments.

- Make the minimum necessary changes to this single file to address the relevant parts of the revision plan.
- Do NOT rewrite the entire file from scratch if a targeted change is possible.
